This repository contains the projects that I worked on for my Computational Methods for Data Analysis class. 

In brief, this course was focused around extracting significant information from datasets.

This information could be in the form of a graph/picture/image that gives insight into patterns within the data, etc. 

Some of the concepts implemented include the fourier and gabor transforms (for signal processing), as well as singular value decomposition and 
linear discretion analysis for working on image reconstruction.
